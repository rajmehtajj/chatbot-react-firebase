# React and Firebase Chat App

This is the project code for my [React and Firebase chatroom app tutorial]. The app uses React for the frontend, Firestore for real-time messaging, and Firebase Authentication for Google authentication.

Some specific React concepts this tutorial teaches are:

* Storing global context with the Context API
* Creating custom hooks for consuming context and synchronizing with external data
* Using unauthenticated and authenticated app components based on the user's authentication state
